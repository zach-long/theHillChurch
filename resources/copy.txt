A Message from the Pastor


Pastor Ricardo Volcy was born in Haiti and has lived in the US since 1989. Pastor Ricardo has lived in New Jersey where he began preaching at the age of 16. Ricardo fell in love with preaching the word of God and youth ministry while serving as the volunteer youth leader at Ebenezer C&MA church in Newark, NJ.


In 2004 Pastor Ricardo left his job, home, and ministry and moved to Moberly, Missouri to pursue a Youth and Family Ministry degree at Central Christian College of the Bible. While at college he met his beautiful wife Christian of 10 years.


Both Ricardo and Christian have a Bachelor degree in Youth and Family Ministry.
He now serves as the lead pastor of Heart of Harrisburg church in Harrisburg, PA. Together with his lovely wife Christian, they have 4 beautiful children Makaela (8), Mykael (4), Madisen (3) and Mia (1). Prior to serving as the lead pastor of the Heart of Harrisburg church, pastor Volcy served as an assistant pastor, youth director, and conference speaker. Pastor Volcy would love the privilege of meeting you in person, join us for one of our Sunday evening services.
