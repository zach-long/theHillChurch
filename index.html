				<h1>Who we are</h1>
				<p>The Hill Church is an urban church located in the heart of Allison Hill in Harrisburg. We aspire to be a visible community that <strong>displays</strong> and <strong>demonstrates</strong> the kingdom of God through our actions. We want to meet, walk, and lead people to discover their purpose for the glory of God. </p>
				<p>The Hill Church is rooted in the principle of community. We want to meet you, no matter where you are in life, and walk beside you on your journey. We recognized a need in Allison Hill for those who seek refuge and guidance, and we aim to fulfill that need.</p>
				<p>If we can change a family, we can change a neighborhood, city and beyond.</p>

				<h1>Our Dream</h1>
				<p>We have big dreams for Harrisburg. We dream of re-establishing to the church as central to the life of our families and our communities. We dream of seeing people joining a redeeming faith through Jesus and living in their new-found faith that builds them up as members of the Kingdom of God. We dream of creating an environment that engages every follower of Jesus Christ and pulls them into a relationship with other local believers. We dream of a healthy, growing, dynamic church community that is committed to worship, discipleship, fellowship and ministries of compassion. We dream of a church community where every follower of Jesus loves the Lord with all their hearts, souls, and minds.</p>
				<p>We have a lot of dreams and a lot of plans. We hope to make a big impact in an area that needs healing the most.</p>
				<p>But we can’t meet those dreams without you.</p>
				<p>Join us as we work to build our church in the heart of  Harrisburg.</p>

				<h1>Our Process</h1>
				<p><strong>Meet</strong></p>
				<p><em>We meet you where you are and love you to where you’re meant be.</em></p>
				<p>It doesn’t matter where you are in life, what your past is, or where you come from. Maybe you’ve lost yourself along the way, or maybe you’re just seeking a new church to worship in. We want to meet you where you are, and figure out how we can help you along your journey.</p>
				<br/>
				<p><strong>Walk</strong></p>
				<p><em>Let us walk with you on your journey.</em></p>
				<p>We want to guide you through life. Sometimes life can be overwhelming, and sometimes it feels like you don’t know where to go. We want to help you through your journey in life and faith. Jesus wants us to sit with people, and that’s what we do. At the Hill Church, we walk by your side, we support you when you feel like giving up, and we stand beside you every step of the way.</p>
				<p>The Hill Church will intentionally seek out opportunities to walk alongside people on their journey. We will live by the motto that <span><em>“life is always better together.”</em></span></p>
				<br/>
				<p><strong>Lead</strong></p>
				<p><em>From being led to leading others.</em></p>
				<p>We don’t want your faith journey to ever stop. We want to continue guiding with you until you feel called to lead and support others in their own paths. Jesus asks us to be disciples and spread the word. We want to help you become advocates for Jesus and followers of His word, so that you too can lead others when you feel called.</p>
				<p>Our desire as a church is to make disciples who make disciples. We’ll continue our legacy through the actions of those rooted in the church.</p>
