				<h1>Who we are</h1>
				<p>The Hill Church is an urban church located in the heart of Allison Hill in Harrisburg. We aspire to be a visible community that <strong>displays</strong> and <strong>demonstrates</strong> the kingdom of God through our actions. We want to meet, walk, and lead people to discover their purpose for the glory of God.</p>
				<p>The Hill Church is rooted in the principle of community. We want to meet you, no matter where you are in life, and walk beside you on your journey. We recognized a need in Allison Hill for those who seek refuge and guidance, and we aim to fulfill that need.</p>
				<p>If we can change a family, we can change a neighborhood, city and beyond.</p>

Jesus wants us to sit with people, and that’s what we do. At the Hill Church, we walk by your side, we support you when you feel like giving up, and we stand beside you every step of the way.</p>
				<p>The Hill Church will intentionally seek out opportunities to walk alongside people on their journey. We will live by the motto that <span><em>“life is always better together.”</em></span></p>

				<p>We don’t want your faith journey to ever stop. We want to continue guiding with you until you feel called to lead and support others in their own paths. Jesus asks us to be disciples and spread the word. We want to help you become advocates for Jesus and followers of His word, so that you too can lead others when you feel called.</p>
				<p>Our desire as a church is to make disciples who make disciples. We’ll continue our legacy through the actions of those rooted in the church.</p>
